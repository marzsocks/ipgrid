# ip-grid - a native jQuery spreadsheet plugin

ip-grid is a fully fledged **native jQuery spreadsheet plugin**, designed to look and feel like Google sheets. And as far as I know, is the most comprehensive spreadsheet plugin on the net.

Development is still in beta so there are a couple of bugs, you can report them on my site:
